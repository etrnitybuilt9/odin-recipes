            <li>1 yellow onion, finely diced</li>
            <li>¾ lb. ground beef</li>
            <li>¾ lb. ground Italian sausage</li>

        <p><h3>Steps:</h3></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><h4>Prep Work</h4></p>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Combine the cheese filling ingredients in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.</li>
        </ol></p>
        <p><h4>Make the Meat Sauce</h4></p>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently while you boil the pasta noodles.</li>
        </ol></p>
        <p><h4>Preheat Oven and Cook the Lasagna Noodles</h4></p>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°F</li>
            <li>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, cook the noodles to al dente according to package instructions. (Set a timer to ensure you don’t overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. Drain and rinse with cold water until noodles are completely cool.</li>
            <li>Top with 4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 ½ cups meat sauce.</li>
            <li>Finish with 4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture, and the rest of the meat sauce.</li>
            <li>Top with 2 ½ cups of Mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray and place it spray-side-down on top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it.</li>
        </ol></p>
        <p><h4>Bake</h4></p>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Bake for 35 minutes. Remove cover and bake for 10 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. Let it sit for 15 minutes prior to serving to allow the layers to set. Serve with garlic bread with cheese.</li>
        </ol></p>
