        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>7.5 oz. softened strawberry cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 tsp lemon zest</li>
            <li>4-5 drops red food coloring, optional</li>
            <li>7.5 oz. marshmallow fluff</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><h3>Steps:</h3></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Note: If using a small tub of strawberry cream cheese spread, it will likely be soft enough as-is for this recipe. If using a block of cream cheese, it will need to sit out at room temperature for up to 1 hour to fully soften in order to combine smoothly with the other ingredients.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine the cream cheese, sour cream, honey, vanilla extract, lemon zest, and food coloring until well-combined.</li>
            <li>Fold in the fluff. The more it is stirred, the fewer air pockets you’ll have which makes it less fluffy. It’s okay to fully combine it, and it’s also okay to leave fluffy little swirls of white throughout the dip. Mine as pictured here, is fully combined.</li>
            <li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour prior to serving, or up to 2 days. Transfer it to a serving bowl and serve with fruit, pretzels, and/or cookies!</li>
