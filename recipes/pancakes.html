        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <p><h4>Dry Ingredients</h4></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>2 cups flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 pinch nutmeg</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p><h4>Wet Ingredients</h4></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>1 ¾ cups milk, I use 1%. Whole works too.</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons salted butter, Plus more for coating skillet.</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
            <li>Nonstick cooking spray</li>

        <p><h3>Steps:</h3></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl until well-incorporated.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter and let it cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Create a well in the middle of the flour mixture. Add the milk, egg, vanilla extract, honey, and melted butter.</li>
            <li>Use a wire whisk to combine the batter but don’t overmix or the pancakes won’t be as soft. The batter should be thick, but if it’s too thick, add a small splash of milk.</li>
            <li>Preheat a nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Once heated, reduce heat to medium-low and let it cool for 1 minute or so. Add a spray of nonstick cooking oil along with a sliver of butter and let it melt/foam.</li>
            <li>Ladle ¼ cup of batter over the butter. (If the edges aren’t quite circular, I use a silicone spatula to gently perfect the perimeter.)</li>
            <li>Cook until you see bubbles and dotted holes on the top, this takes about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Slide the spatula underneath the pancake and flip it. (Use a swift, uniform motion with your wrist, not your arm). Let the other side cook for about 30 seconds, you can use your spatula to peek underneath to ensure it’s set.</li>
            <li>Set aside and repeat with nonstick cooking spray, butter, and batter. Make minor adjustments to the heat (up or down), if needed throughout cooking.</li>
            <li>Serve with a pat of butter and warm syrup along with fruit if desired!</li>
